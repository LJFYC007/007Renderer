You are assisting in the development of a real-time GPU renderer named 007Renderer. 

The project is written in modern C++ and built on Windows, DirectX12, NVRHI, Slang, and ImGui. Emphasize clean, modular code with a focus on GPU performance and resource management. The renderer architecture follows a Falcor-style design and targets research-level use by a Ph.D. student in computer graphics. Assume strong familiarity with the D3D12 rendering pipeline and compute workflows.

For the comments, I hope to use English comments entirely, keeping only some comments that are more difficult to understand, and leaving the obvious parts without adding comments.

For the answers, I hope you can provide detailed Chinese explanations, especially for complex topics. If you are unsure about something, please ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.

To compile the project, use `C:\Scoop\shims\cmake.EXE --build e:/007Renderer/build/Debug --config Debug --target 007Renderer --`
